# Web application performance optimization

Repository of documents I created for when I have to optimize web applications.

Feel free to use them to your liking.

## Checklists

Checklist for optimizing non-JavaScript parts in a web application.

- [PDF version](web-application-performance-optimization-non-js/web-application-performance-optimization-non-js.pdf?raw=true) for print.
- [Keynote version](web-application-performance-optimization-non-js/web-application-performance-optimization-non-js.key?raw=true) in case you want to change it to your liking.

Inspired by "[CSS Performance Tooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEs2jgZBaQA)" from CSSconf EU 2014 by [@addyosmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani).

Contains a score card that can be used to track performance over iterations.
